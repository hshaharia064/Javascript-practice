after a long time i'm starting to commit in github again. 
from past 4 months i was learning javascript free sources without taking any paid courses.
and i had a potato laptop which i borowed from a friend. this is why my learning was a bit slow.
now i have my own laptop and 
practicing around 10 hours daily :)
